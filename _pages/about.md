About Me
============

I am Statistician and Machine Learning scientist. I recently defended my PhD thesis in Statistics & Machine Learning at CMAP, Ecole Polytechnique and TotalEnergies in a CIFRE Contract (Industrial PhD). I am supervised by [Josselin Garnier](https://josselin-garnier.org/), professor at the [CMAP Laboratory](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/en/presentation), Ecole Polytechnique and Antoine Bertoncello, senior research engineer at [TotalEnergies OneTech](https://totalenergies.publispeak.com/shareholders-newsletter-67/doc/article/8/).

My research project was about _Statistical learning and causal inference_. The objective is to develop a data-driven approach, coupling **causality** with **machine learning**, for optimization and decision making, with a focus on **uncertainty quantification**.

Here, you will find link to my publications, talks, and my resume. You can also find on the left-hand side links to my social accounts and e-mail, feel free to contact me.
Have a good day !
