About Me
============

I am a 2nd year PhD student in Statistics & Machine Learning at CMAP, Ecole Polytechnique and TotalEnergies (ex Total) in a CIFRE Contract. I am supervised by [Josselin Garnier](https://josselin-garnier.org/), professor at the CMAP laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique and Antoine Bertoncello, senior research engineer at TotalEnergies R&D.

I am particulary interested in the statistics, Machine Learning, Uncertainty Quantification and Causal Inference.

The objective of my actual research project is to develop a data-driven approach, coupling causality with machine learning, for optimization and decision making, with a focus on uncertainty quantification.

Here, you will find link to my publications, talks, and my resume. You can also find on the left-hand side links to my social accounts and e-mail, feel free to contact me.
Have a good day !
