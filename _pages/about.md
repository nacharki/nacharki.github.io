About Me
============

I am a 2nd year PhD student in Statistics & Machine Learning at CMAP, Ecole Polytechnique and TotalEnergies (ex Total) in CIFRE Contract. I am supervised by Josselin Garnier, professor at the CMAP laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique and Antoine Bertoncello, senior research engineer at TotalEnergies R&D.

My research interests focus on Statistics, Machine Learning, Uncertainty Quantification and Causal Inference. The objective of my research project is to develop a data-driven approach, coupling causality with machine learning, for optimization and decision making, with a focus on uncertainty quantification.
